      <p>
        After many arduous years of dedication (four hours), the gremblotech
        website is finally live, and almost barely functional! Enjoy several
        wonderful and innovative features of the modern web. For example:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A timer that is right once per day</li>
        <li>A gremblo button that currently does nothing</li>
        <li>
          Cutting-edge 4:3 display technology that automatically resizes based
          on your browser window
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We here at gremblotech value your love and support and hope you stay
        tuned for the next update, sure to bring you hours of childlike fun!
